# FirstPass
The simplest way to decide which classes to enroll in for your first pass at UCLA. <br/>
  Data is based on enrollment from Winter 2020 and was drawn from the UCLA Registrar's Office.

# How to launch FirstPass
We recommend launching this app using Visual Studio Code. <br/>
If your machine does not have it, download it here: https://code.visualstudio.com/download. <br/>
Clone the entire Git repository onto your local machine and open it in Visual Studio Code so all the folders and files can be accessed.<br/>
Open a shell within Visual Studio Code.<br/>
Use the command 'npm start' to launch the web app.<br/>
Note: If your local machine does not have all the necessary packages, it may be necessary to run 'npm install' first.<br/>
After a moment, the web app will launch in your machine's browser.<br/>

# How to use FirstPass
First, input your current standing. This will help the app know approximately when your First Pass begins.<br/>
Next, input a list of classes you are interested in using the dropdown menu.<br/>
Once you have chosen all your classes, submit using the button below. <br/>
On the right side of the screen there will be a list of classes that you should First Pass along with how long they usually take to fill up (in green text),<br/>
a list of classes that are likely to have filled before your First Pass (in red text), <br/>
and a list of classes that you should Second Pass because they are unlikely to fill up (in black text).<br/>
Use this information to help you strategize which classes you should enroll in during your First Pass next quarter!<br/>

# How to use Login
To create an account, enter your email and a password.<br/>
An option to "Save Classes" will appear at the bottom of the screen. This will save your selected classes so if you need to come back 
and check on them in the future, you don't need to re-enter them.<br/>
If desired, click Logout after finishing.<br/>
The next time you want to check your classes, simply Login with your email and password at the bottom of the screen. <br/>
Your classes will be saved in the dropdown and you simply select your standing and search again!<br/>
